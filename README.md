# Weather Detector

## Description
This is a simple weather detector script written in Python that retrieves and displays weather information for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The script prompts the user to enter a city name, and then it fetches and displays the current temperature, weather description, humidity level, and wind speed for that location.

## Prerequisites

1.Python (3.6 or above)
2.Requests library (install using pip install requests)

## Usage

2.Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the weather_detector.py script.

## API Key
To use this weather detector, you need to obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap. You can sign up for a free API key at OpenWeatherMap. After obtaining the API key, replace the value of the api_key variable in the weather_detector.py script.
